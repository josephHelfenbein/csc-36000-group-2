The primary node controls the whole computation.
Secondary nodes help by doing parts of the work.
The primary node divides the work and sends it to the secondary nodes.
All nodes work at the same time to finish faster.
If a secondary node stops working or crashes, the primary node notices.
The failed node is removed so it won’t be used again.
The unfinished work from the failed node is sent to another working node.
The system keeps running without stopping.
This makes the distributed system more reliable and fault tolerant.
